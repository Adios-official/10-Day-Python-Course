# Exercise 4.1: A Function Calling Another Function
# Functions can call other functions to help them do their job. This is great for breaking down complex problems.

# Exercise 4.2: A Function Calling Itself (Recursion)
# This is an advanced topic, but cool to see! Recursion is when a function calls itself.
# It MUST have a "base case" to know when to stop, otherwise it creates an infinite loop.

def countdown(number):
    # BASE CASE: If the number is zero or less, stop.
    if number <= 0:
        print("Blast off! ðŸš€")
        return # This stops the function

    # RECURSIVE STEP: Print the number, then call itself with a smaller number.
    print(number)
    countdown(number - 1)
