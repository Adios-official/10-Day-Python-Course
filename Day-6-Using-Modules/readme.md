# ‚û°Ô∏è Day 6: Using Modules - Python's Superpowers

On Day 6, we learned how to unlock Python's vast ecosystem of pre-built tools by using **modules**. Instead of writing everything from scratch, we can import powerful code written by others to add new features to our programs instantly.

* **Cheat Sheet:** [`day_6_cheatsheet.md`](./6_cheatsheet.md)

### ‚≠ê Key Concepts Covered:

* **The `import` Statement:** How to bring a module's functionality into our program.
* **The `random` Module:** For generating random numbers (`randint`), making random choices from lists (`choice`), and shuffling sequences (`shuffle`).
* **The `math` Module:** For accessing mathematical constants (`pi`) and functions (`sqrt`).
* **The `datetime` and `time` Modules:** For getting the current date/time and pausing program execution (`sleep`).
* **Different Import Styles:** Using `from...import` and `import...as` for cleaner code.

### üí° Highlight Snippet:

```python
import random
import time

# A list of possible responses
responses = ["Yes, definitely.", "My reply is no.", "Ask again later."]

print("Thinking...")
time.sleep(2) # Create a dramatic pause

# Use a function from the 'random' module to pick a response
fortune = random.choice(responses)
print(f"The Magic 8-Ball says: '{fortune}'")
