# Let's start with a set of approved users

# Use .add() to add a new user. If the user already exists, nothing happens.
approved_users.add("David")

print("After adding users:", approved_users)

# Use .remove() to delete an item. This will cause an ERROR if the item doesn't exist.
approved_users.remove("Bob")
print("After removing 'Bob':", approved_users)
# The following line would cause an error:
# approved_users.remove("Eve") # Raises a KeyError because "Eve" is not in the set

# Use .discard() for safe removal. It does nothing if the item isn't there.
approved_users.discard("Charlie") # Removes "Charlie"
approved_users.discard("Eve")     # Does nothing, no error

# YOUR CODE HERE - Manage tags for a blog post:
# 1. Create a list of tags with some duplicates, e.g., ["python", "code", "fun", "python", "guide"].
# 2. Create a set from this list to get the unique tags.
# 3. A new tag "beginner" needs to be added. Use .add().
# 4. The "fun" tag is no longer relevant. Remove it.
# 5. Print the final set of tags.
