# Exercise 6.1: Creating and Using Basic Variables
# Learn to store information in labeled containers
name = "Alex"  # String variable
age = 16       # Number variable
is_student = True  # Boolean variable (True/False)

print("Basic Variable Usage:")
print("My name is", name)
print("I am", age, "years old")

# YOUR CODE HERE - Create your own basic variables:
# Make variables for: your name, age, favorite color, favorite number
# Then display them in creative sentences

# Exercise 6.2: Modifying and Updating Variables
# Learn that variables can change their values

score = score + 10  # Add to the score
print("After bonus:", score)

score = score * 2   # Double the score
