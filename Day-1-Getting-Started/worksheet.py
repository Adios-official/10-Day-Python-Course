# Exercise 1.1: Basic Print Statements
# Learn how to display simple messages
print("Hello, my name is [YOUR NAME]")
print("I am learning Python programming!")
print("This is going to be awesome!")

# YOUR CODE HERE - Create 3 print statements about yourself:




# Exercise 1.2: Print with Spacing and Formatting
# Learn how empty print() creates blank lines for better formatting
print("My Information:")
print()  # This creates a blank line
print("Name: [Your Name]")
print("Age: [Your Age]")
print()  # Another blank line
print("Thank you for reading!")

# YOUR CODE HERE - Create a nicely formatted list of your favorite things:
# Use empty print() statements to make it look organized




# Exercise 1.3: Print with Special Characters and Emojis
# Learn to use special symbols and emojis in your output
print("★ Special Characters are Fun! ★")

# Handle complex text that contains various quote types
print("""The teacher explained: "When you're coding in Python, 
remember that both 'single quotes' and \"double quotes\" work.
But be careful about mixing them!"

The student asked: "What if I need to use both types together?"

"Great question!" replied the teacher. "That's when you use
triple quotes like I'm doing right now!\"""")
